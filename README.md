# crwn-clothing

I created this during a course to dive deeper into React and Redux. It's a clothing store that stores assets and accounts in Firebase. The app contains
cart functionality, account management, stripe integration, and some animations I added. View the project at: https://ecom-crown-clothing.herokuapp.com/ (since it's deployed on a free Heroku account, it may take some time to load).
